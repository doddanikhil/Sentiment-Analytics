apple,My app became App of the Day this week ‚Äì here‚Äôs the story (and I‚Äôm giving away free access),330,1jy73za,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1jy73za/my_app_became_app_of_the_day_this_week_heres_the/,538,1744549270.0,"Last Monday, my app Griply became [App of the Day in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/story/id1800487134) and honestly, it still feels surreal.

I‚Äôve been designing iOS apps since the days of skeuomorphism - iOS 6 was where it all started for me. Ever since, I‚Äôve been fascinated by the idea of building tools that don‚Äôt just look great, but *actually help people live better lives*.

But when it came to working on my own goals, nothing really worked. I had long-term goals in one place, habits in another, and daily tasks in a third - and no real sense of how it all connected. It felt unnecessarily complex. I wanted one tool that brought it all together.

So I started sketching. And teamed up with two others I met at an app agency in Utrecht (the Netherlands). Later a fourth joined to help us bring it to more platforms.

**The journey**

We started Griply in 2021 as a side project (nights, weekends, whenever we could). For a long time it was slow, steady progress.

Then a little over a year ago, we quit our jobs and went all in. We‚Äôre fully bootstrapped, so no funding, no safety net - just the belief that if we kept listening to users and improving the product, it would start to resonate.

Since December, things have really started picking up. Steady growth, strong retention, and amazing feedback from users who finally feel like they‚Äôve found the system that works for them.

And last Monday, Griply became App of the Day in the UK and Ireland App Stores.

Seeing it featured by Apple was one of those moments you dream about when you start something like this.

**What Griply does**

Griply connects your goals, habits, and daily tasks in one place - so you can make real progress toward what matters, not just tick off tasks.

* Break goals into subgoals, habits and tasks
* Make goals measurable (e.g. km, books, weight, $)
* Track visual progress with clean charts
* Plan your day with everything goal-connected
* Plan your goals on a yearly or 5‚Äì10 year roadmap
* Use widgets to not lose sight of goals, tasks, or habits
* Works across iOS, Mac, Web & Windows

We ship updates (almost) every week and nearly every feature we‚Äôve added came from real user feedback.

**üéÅ¬†To celebrate the App of the Day feature, I‚Äôm doing a small giveaway:**

1. **First 25 replies: Lifetime Premium**
2. **Next 25: 1 year Premium**
3. **Next 50: 6 months Premium**
4. **Everyone else: 1 month Premium**

**Just reply and send me a DM with the email you used to sign up. I‚Äôll unlock premium access manually.**

üì±¬†Download the app here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747)¬†

We‚Äôre still a small, self-funded team of four, building this with a lot of passion.

If you enjoy discovering indie apps - or have thoughts on how we could make Griply better - I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

And if you decide to support us with a rating or review, it would honestly mean the world.

Thanks for reading!

apple,Substage - a natural language command bar that attaches to Finder windows,14,1jyana9,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1jyana9/substage_a_natural_language_command_bar_that/,2,1744559212.0,"Hey folks!

I‚Äôm a solo indie dev making¬†[Substage](https://substage.app), a command bar that sits neatly below Finder windows and lets you interact with your files using natural language.

During my day job I‚Äôm a game developer, I‚Äôve found it super useful for converting videos and images, checking metadata, and more. Although I‚Äôm a coder, I consider myself ‚Äúsemi-technical‚Äù! I‚Äôll avoid using the command line whenever I can üòÖ So although I understand that there‚Äôs a lot of power beyond the command line, I can never remember the exact command line arguments for just about anything.

I love the workflow of being able to just select a bunch of files, and tell Substage what I want to do with them - convert them, compress them, introspect them etc. You can also do stuff that doesn‚Äôt relate to specific files such as calculations, web requests etc too.

How it works:

1. First, it converts your prompt into a Terminal command using an LLM (OpenAI etc, or using local integration with LM Studio / Ollama)
2. If a command is potentially risky, it‚Äôll ask for confirmation first before running it.
3. After running, it runs the output back through an LLM to summarise it

I‚Äôd love to hear any feedback on any aspect of the app, thanks! Website is: [substage.app](http://substage.app)

apple,4.Do - An Eisenhower Matrix app for IOS and Mac,8,1jy45cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1jy45cj/4do_an_eisenhower_matrix_app_for_ios_and_mac/,60,1744537887.0,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm Ayo, a self-taught developer for Android and iOS. I created a productivity app for Android years ago which I‚Äôm excited to finally bring to iOS and Mac!

I know ‚Äî another productivity app, right? But hear me out.

4.Do is a task manager built around the Eisenhower Matrix. It helps you focus on what actually matters by dividing tasks into four simple categories: important, urgent, both, or neither. If your to-do list constantly feels overwhelming, this method can help you zero in on what truly moves the needle. This is useful for everyone but can be especially useful for people with ADHD like me.

While I‚Äôm not the first to use this idea, I‚Äôve aimed to make it as intuitive and visually clean as possible‚Äîsomething you‚Äôll actually want to use daily.

**Features:**

4.Do has been built natively for iOS and MacOS to make full use of each platforms strengths and size advantages including but not limited to a lot of what you would expect from a task app: Reminder notifications, subtasks, attachments, repetition, tags/filters, iCloud sync.

Plus

\- Quadrant and regular list view (Calendar and Kanban views planned)

\- Quadrant customizations

\- Drag and drop between quadrant

\- Lots of widgets

\- Control center widgets

\- Menu bar app (Mac only)

\- Sticky floating windows (Mac only)

\- Siri Shortcuts

\- Task heatmap and completion distribution charts

**Price:**

4.Do is free to download with most of its features being free and advanced features and customizations being paid. Most users will probably find the free features more than enough though.

**Privacy**

The only information I collect is anonymized crash data to help find and fix bugs. I have zero interest in who you are or your data.

I believe these are Nike Dunk Lows (Retro?) but I can't seem to find the exact color combination. Everything I find or that I'm able to customize doesn't offer all the components. To me, it looks like:

* toe/tongue and mid panel/collar are not white but a pastel/light salmon or creamsicle

* **pastel/light salmon or creamsicle laces,** **matching toe/tongue and mid panel/collar**
* Monarch Orange tip/accent
* White midsole
* Magma Orange outsole and lining

In addition, many malls are increasingly run-down, and a blighted mall is a turnoff.

Now the only malls left are Haywood, Westgate and Anderson malls.  Haywood is a mid-tier mall, and Westgate and Anderson malls are run-down and feature low-end stores. Higher-end stores are in downtown Greenville and here and there in other locations, but not generally in malls.

Belk, Dillard's and Macy's have stayed in malls.  The other stores in those malls don't attract the same broad range of customers as department stores attract, and the run-down condition of the malls is a turnoff.

This is problematic for a few reasons. One, you‚Äôre gonna kill your back. The job is already rough on your body as it is, but reaching like that will make it worse. 

Two, if the belt doesn‚Äôt advance, the next customer can‚Äôt load their items. It‚Äôs irritating to stand there with some items loaded, not being able to load more, while there‚Äôs empty room up front because the cashier isn‚Äôt letting the belt advance.

The reason is that I feel like handling disputes/chargebacks on Stripe is more difficult and the bank tends to  side with the buyer more. I'll give some examples below.

I have been using PayPal too and it seems the buyer/seller protection is overall stronger.

But when it's CC payments, does PayPal help more to counter disputes or is it just like Stripe?
Stripe ist just a middleman, I know, but the banks side with buyers more often anyway.

Personal examples of Stripe disputes I've lost (unfairly):
- buyer claims shipment did not arrive and after sending proof with their signature we still lost
- buyer claims items are broken to get the money back, while in reality they just don't want to deal with returning an item (they admitted they just don't like the color)

I have tried absolutely everything you can think of to try to get my CVR up. From small optimizations to complete website rebuilds to buying expensive CROs from experts. I bet there is nothing you can think of that I haven't tried. 

Sure, all of this did help me a little bit with my conversions, but it didn't bring me back anywhere close to where I once was. 

Then this morning I had the randomest urge to go through all my orders one by one. I noticed something interesting - at least a third of all orders, if not half, had multiple payment attempts. And most abandoned checkouts had failed payment attempts. My Stripe account allows me to see why these transactions didn't go through, and nearly ALL of them failed due to insufficient funds.

(I sell a relatively higher ticket item so this may not be the case for you.)

This was an eye opening moment. I felt bad for the world, man. We spend all our time trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of our customers, when many of them are literally giving us their last dollars. Maybe they have really stressful lives and retail therapy provides them some relief and distraction.

As a result of this new insight, I am going to focus less on my conversion rate and more on taking better care of my existing customers.

ecommerce,Why I Left Etsy and Built My Own Online E-commerce Art Shop,40,1jxhdx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1jxhdx0/why_i_left_etsy_and_built_my_own_online_ecommerce/,19,1744464748.0,"I left Etsy about two years ago. At first, it felt like a terrifying decision. After all, Etsy is the giant marketplace where artists and makers sell their creations. It offers built-in traffic, a ready-made audience, and a system that takes care of the technical aspects of running an online store. But here‚Äôs the thing: the deeper I got into it, the more I realized Etsy wasn‚Äôt working for me‚Äîit was working against me.

The Harsh Reality of Selling on Etsy

Let‚Äôs talk about Etsy‚Äôs fees. They take a 30% cut of your earnings when you factor in listing fees, transaction fees, and payment processing deductions. That‚Äôs a massive chunk of every sale gone before you even see your profits. For an artist who spends hours, sometimes weeks, crafting a piece, that fee starts to feel like a rip-off.

Etsy defends its pricing by claiming it brings you traffic, which is true to some extent. But here‚Äôs the catch: that traffic doesn‚Äôt belong to you. It belongs to Etsy. You might get visitors to your shop, but they are constantly being presented with alternative options‚Äîsometimes directly beneath your own listings. It felt like I was doing the work of bringing people to Etsy‚Äôs platform, only for Etsy to push them towards other sellers.

I started wondering: Am I the business here, or am I just another cog in Etsy‚Äôs machine? Am I building my brand, or am I just feeding theirs?

The Hidden Competition and the Flood of Mass-Produced ""Art""

One of the most frustrating things I experienced on Etsy was the growing influx of mass-produced, factory-made ‚Äúart‚Äù flooding the marketplace. These pieces, often produced in bulk from overseas manufacturers, were being marketed alongside handmade, original works by real artists. Customers browsing Etsy might not even realize the difference.

And the worst part? Etsy allowed it.

The platform, originally built to celebrate craftsmanship and unique creations, had turned into just another marketplace filled with mass production. Competing with real artists was one thing‚Äîbut competing with mass-manufactured products? That was the final dealbreaker for me.

The Leap to Independence: Building My Own Art Platform

So, I left.

I started building my own art platform. No more reliance on Etsy‚Äôs algorithm, no more worrying about mass-produced copies being marketed next to my work, no more losing 30% of every sale. It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt an overnight success.

Did I get rich? No.

Did it cost me everything? Not really.

Was it hard? Yes‚Äîbut it was also incredibly rewarding.

Running my own store gave me full control. I decided how my art was presented, how my customers experienced my shop, and how I built relationships with buyers. Instead of being just another seller lost in Etsy‚Äôs ocean, I was able to carve out a dedicated space where my art took center stage.

The Challenges of Running Your Own Art Store

I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it: running your own shop comes with its own set of challenges. Here are a few things I had to navigate:

1. Driving My Own Traffic

Etsy does bring traffic, but as I said earlier, it‚Äôs not really your traffic. Once I left, I had to figure out how to get eyes on my work. I spent time learning about SEO, social media marketing, and email newsletters. It was a learning curve, but over time, I started seeing real results‚Äîresults that belonged to me, not Etsy.

2. Managing Tech & Logistics

Etsy handles payments, shipping calculations, and customer inquiries. Running my own site meant setting all that up myself. It took time, but once it was in place, I actually found it easier to manage than I expected.

3. Building Trust with Customers

Etsy offers a layer of trust because buyers feel secure purchasing from a well-known platform. When you run your own site, you have to build that trust yourself through great customer service, transparent policies, and high-quality product photography and descriptions.

The Wins: Why It Was All Worth It

For every challenge, there was a win that made it all worth it.

Every sale feels more personal. When an order comes in from Australia, Sweden, or Switzerland, I know that person found me‚Äînot just my shop buried in a sea of listings. These are NOT example countries, believe me or not I really sold already to all these countries some of my art! Incredible right?
I set my own rules. No more Etsy policies dictating how I can market or price my work. What pictures I am allowed to upload and asking for getting my article ‚Äúapproved‚Äù. Never again!
Higher profits per sale. Without Etsy‚Äôs fees eating away at every transaction, I actually earn what my work is worth. And it feels very good, I can tell you that!
Stronger connections with buyers. I‚Äôm not just another anonymous seller on a platform. I can build relationships with people who truly appreciate my work. And I have a chance of actually building my name as unique Artists not a number on an ebay sized art platform.
Should You Leave Etsy?

This isn‚Äôt to say that Etsy is all bad. If you‚Äôre just starting out and need immediate visibility, it might be worth trying. But if you‚Äôre frustrated by the constant fee hikes, the overwhelming competition, and the flood of mass-produced goods, then maybe it‚Äôs time to think about your own store.

Leaving Etsy isn‚Äôt for everyone. It requires effort, patience, and a willingness to learn. But if you value independence and want to build something that truly belongs to you, it‚Äôs absolutely possible‚Äîand incredibly rewarding.

A Thank You to Those Who Have Supported My Work

So here I am, more than a year into this adventure. It‚Äôs been a ride, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything. To everyone who has supported my art, whether by making a purchase, following along on social media, or just reading this post‚Äîthank you.

If you‚Äôre thinking about leaving Etsy and building your own store, I hope this post gives you the encouragement to take that leap. And if you‚Äôre here just to browse my art, thank you for being here. Every visitor, every supporter, and every fellow artist who shares this journey means the world to me.

Here‚Äôs to creating, to independence, and to making art on our terms.

pieces often produced in bulk from overseas manufacturers were being marketed alongside handmade original works by real artists Customers browsing Etsy might not even realize the difference And the worst part Etsy allowed it The platform originally built to celebrate craftsmanship and unique creations had turned into just another marketplace filled with mass production Competing with real artists was one thingbut competing with massmanufactured products That was the final dealbreaker for me The Leap to Independence Building My Own Art Platform So I left I started building my own art platform No more reliance on Etsys algorithm no more worrying about massproduced copies being marketed next to my work no more losing 30 of every sale It wasnt an easy decision and it certainly wasnt an overnight success Did I get rich No Did it cost me everything Not really Was it hard Yesbut it was also incredibly rewarding Running my own store gave me full control I decided how my art was presented how my customers experienced my shop and how I built relationships with buyers Instead of being just another seller lost in Etsys ocean I was able to carve out a dedicated space where my art took center stage The Challenges of Running Your Own Art Store I wont sugarcoat it running your own shop comes with its own set of challenges Here are a few things I had to navigate 1 Driving My Own Traffic Etsy does bring traffic but as I said earlier its not really your traffic Once I left I had to figure out how to get eyes on my work I spent time learning about SEO social media marketing and email newsletters It was a learning curve but over time I started seeing real resultsresults that belonged to me not Etsy 2 Managing Tech Logistics Etsy handles payments shipping calculations and customer inquiries Running my own site meant setting all that up myself It took time but once it was in place I actually found it easier to manage than I expected 3 Building Trust with Customers Etsy offers a layer of trust because buyers feel secure purchasing from a wellknown platform When you run your own site you have to build that trust yourself through great customer service transparent policies and highquality product photography and descriptions The Wins Why It Was All Worth It For every challenge there was a win that made it all worth it Every sale feels more personal When an order comes in from Australia Sweden or Switzerland I know that person found menot just my shop buried in a sea of listings These are NOT example countries believe me or not I really sold already to all these countries some of my art Incredible right I set my own rules No more Etsy policies dictating how I can market or price my work What pictures I am allowed to upload and asking for getting my article approved Never again Higher profits per sale Without Etsys fees eating away at every transaction I actually earn what my work is worth And it feels very good I can tell you that Stronger connections with buyers Im not just another anonymous seller on a platform I can build relationships with people who truly appreciate my work And I have a chance of actually building my name as unique Artists not a number on an ebay sized art platform Should You Leave Etsy This isnt to say that Etsy is all bad If youre just starting out and need immediate visibility it might be worth trying But if youre frustrated by the constant fee hikes the overwhelming competition and the flood of massproduced goods then maybe its time to think about your own store Leaving Etsy isnt for everyone It requires effort patience and a willingness to learn But if you value independence and want to build something that truly belongs to you its absolutely possibleand incredibly rewarding A Thank You to Those Who Have Supported My Work So here I am more than a year into this adventure Its been a ride but I wouldnt trade it for anything To everyone who has supported my art whether by making a purchase following along on social media or just reading this postthank you If youre thinking about leaving Etsy and building your own store I hope this post gives you the encouragement to take that leap And if youre here just to browse my art thank you for being here Every visitor every supporter and every fellow artist who shares this journey means the world to me Heres to creating to independence and to making art on our terms Peter Hauerland,positive

Then they put together a PDF, with a guide on how to get started. Here is the PDF...

ecommerce,How do you manage data across multiple channels for your e-commerce? Need help with my system.,1,1jxkbvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1jxkbvz/how_do_you_manage_data_across_multiple_channels/,3,1744472993.0,"Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well!  
  
I recently started working with an e-commerce store (found them on Upwork) to automate their sales and inventory data aggregation. They changed the entire concept twice already, massively expanding my original scope. Because of that, I‚Äôm planning either to finalize the project as is or ask them to formally increase the scope and budget if they want additional improvements. But got into thinking that maybe it‚Äôs worth to finish it off anyway as something valuable for others, because had a problem with finding exact alternative.

I wanted to discuss with those of you who own e-commerce and sell across multiple channels whether tools that offer similar functionalities exist and what they are, so I could propose as alternative(since the client doesn‚Äôt fully like one part of current implementation - but more about it in a second).

**So, what is it all about?**

My client sells across various channels, including Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Etsy, and TikTok. Each weekend, they manually compile inventory reports from several dashboards - including those related to inventory management, like Amazon, ShipStation and Lacore(never heard about it before) into a single spreadsheet to track demand, shortages, and other metrics.

I was tasked with creating three automated spreadsheets: an Inventory Report, a Sales Value Report, and a Sales Units Report.

Here's the workflow we agreed upon:

**Inventory Workflow**  
Everything begins with a master Google Sheet called the ‚ÄúProducts List,‚Äù which acts as the reference point for all the items you want to track. Each product‚Äôs key identifiers (like SKUs or ASINs) are stored here, so if a product doesn‚Äôt appear in this list, it won‚Äôt show up in your reports.

The system once a week collects fresh inventory information from multiple platforms - such as Amazon, Walmart, ShipStation, and Lacore - automatically. Since each platform might label the same item differently, the data is cross-checked against what‚Äôs in the ‚ÄúProducts List.‚Äù Once everything lines up, a single Google Sheet compiles it all. This sheet includes separate tabs showing inventory stats from each source (e.g., an Amazon tab, a Walmart tab, etc.) as well as a combined summary tab. They‚Äôre organised by weeks of the year, so every time the system updates, you can see a week-by-week history of how many units you have available, inbound, or unfulfillable.

**Sales Workflow**  
The process for sales is very similar, also relying on the same ‚ÄúProducts List‚Äù to match each product regardless of whether Amazon calls it an ASIN or Walmart uses a SKU. The system automatically grabs the data, ensuring you don‚Äôt have to log in and export reports yourself.

All those transactions are cleaned and merged into one Google Sheet that includes sub-tabs for each sales channel, plus an overall summary of your total revenue and units sold. As with inventory, the data is laid out by weeks of the year, letting you quickly scroll through and see how your sales have changed over time, all in a single, user-friendly workbook.

Currently, one issue with this system is that the sales data isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't account for canceled or returned orders. Addressing this requires a more complex approach than simple weekly data aggregation.

My questions are:¬†

1. Are there any existing off-the-shelf solutions you would recommend that perform similar multichannel data gathering functions? What do you use? This would allow me to suggest alternatives to my clients.
2. Secondly, does having centralised, automated spreadsheets (or another format) for inventory and sales provide significant value that e-commerce owners might appreciate? How does that work in the real world?
