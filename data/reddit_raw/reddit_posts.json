        "text": "Last Monday, my app Griply became [App of the Day in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/story/id1800487134) and honestly, it still feels surreal.\n\nI\u2019ve been designing iOS apps since the days of skeuomorphism - iOS 6 was where it all started for me. Ever since, I\u2019ve been fascinated by the idea of building tools that don\u2019t just look great, but *actually help people live better lives*.\n\nBut when it came to working on my own goals, nothing really worked. I had long-term goals in one place, habits in another, and daily tasks in a third - and no real sense of how it all connected. It felt unnecessarily complex. I wanted one tool that brought it all together.\n\nSo I started sketching. And teamed up with two others I met at an app agency in Utrecht (the Netherlands). Later a fourth joined to help us bring it to more platforms.\n\n**The journey**\n\nWe started Griply in 2021 as a side project (nights, weekends, whenever we could). For a long time it was slow, steady progress.\n\nThen a little over a year ago, we quit our jobs and went all in. We\u2019re fully bootstrapped, so no funding, no safety net - just the belief that if we kept listening to users and improving the product, it would start to resonate.\n\nSince December, things have really started picking up. Steady growth, strong retention, and amazing feedback from users who finally feel like they\u2019ve found the system that works for them.\n\nAnd last Monday, Griply became App of the Day in the UK and Ireland App Stores.\n\nSeeing it featured by Apple was one of those moments you dream about when you start something like this.\n\n**What Griply does**\n\nGriply connects your goals, habits, and daily tasks in one place - so you can make real progress toward what matters, not just tick off tasks.\n\n* Break goals into subgoals, habits and tasks\n* Make goals measurable (e.g. km, books, weight, $)\n* Track visual progress with clean charts\n* Plan your day with everything goal-connected\n* Plan your goals on a yearly or 5\u201310 year roadmap\n* Use widgets to not lose sight of goals, tasks, or habits\n* Works across iOS, Mac, Web & Windows\n\nWe ship updates (almost) every week and nearly every feature we\u2019ve added came from real user feedback.\n\n**\ud83c\udf81\u00a0To celebrate the App of the Day feature, I\u2019m doing a small giveaway:**\n\n1. **First 25 replies: Lifetime Premium**\n2. **Next 25: 1 year Premium**\n3. **Next 50: 6 months Premium**\n4. **Everyone else: 1 month Premium**\n\n**Just reply and send me a DM with the email you used to sign up. I\u2019ll unlock premium access manually.**\n\n\ud83d\udcf1\u00a0Download the app here: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1556692747)\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re still a small, self-funded team of four, building this with a lot of passion.\n\nIf you enjoy discovering indie apps - or have thoughts on how we could make Griply better - I\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nAnd if you decide to support us with a rating or review, it would honestly mean the world.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n**EDIT: Wow, thank you all for the support - it really means a lot! I\u2019m going through my inbox like crazy, but it\u2019s going to take a while. I\u2019ll get back to everyone!**"

Although I\u2019m a coder, I consider myself \u201csemi-technical\u201d! I\u2019ll avoid using the command line whenever I can \ud83d\ude05 So although I understand that there\u2019s a lot of power beyond the command line, I can never remember the exact command line arguments for just about anything.\n\nI love the workflow of being able to just select a bunch of files, and tell Substage what I want to do with them - convert them, compress them, introspect them etc. You can also do stuff that doesn\u2019t relate to specific files such as calculations, web requests etc too.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. First, it converts your prompt into a Terminal command using an LLM (OpenAI etc, or using local integration with LM Studio / Ollama)\n2. If a command is potentially risky, it\u2019ll ask for confirmation first before running it.\n3. After running, it runs the output back through an LLM to summarise it\n\nI\u2019d love to hear any feedback on any aspect of the app, thanks! Website is: [substage.app](http://substage.app)\n\n(Edit: if you saw this twice, apologies! I posted original with wrong flair and less clear title, which I have now deleted)"

I created a productivity app for Android years ago which I\u2019m excited to finally bring to iOS and Mac!\n\nI know \u2014 another productivity app, right? But hear me out.\n\n4.Do is a task manager built around the Eisenhower Matrix. It helps you focus on what actually matters by dividing tasks into four simple categories: important, urgent, both, or neither. If your to-do list constantly feels overwhelming, this method can help you zero in on what truly moves the needle. This is useful for everyone but can be especially useful for people with ADHD like me.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not the first to use this idea, I\u2019ve aimed to make it as intuitive and visually clean as possible\u2014something you\u2019ll actually want to use daily.\n\n**Features:**\n\n4.Do has been built natively for iOS and MacOS to make full use of each platforms strengths and size advantages including but not limited to a lot of what you would expect from a task app: Reminder notifications, subtasks, attachments, repetition, tags/filters, iCloud sync.\n\nPlus\n\n\\- Quadrant and regular list view (Calendar and Kanban views planned)\n\n\\- Quadrant customizations\n\n\\- Drag and drop between quadrant\n\n\\- Lots of widgets\n\n\\- Control center widgets\n\n\\- Menu bar app (Mac only)\n\n\\- Sticky floating windows (Mac only)\n\n\\- Siri Shortcuts\n\n\\- Task heatmap and completion distribution charts\n\n**Price:**\n\n4.Do is free to download with most of its features being free and advanced features and customizations being paid. Most users will probably find the free features more than enough though.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nThe only information I collect is anonymized crash data to help find and fix bugs. I have zero interest in who you are or your data.\n\n**Promo Codes:**\n\nI have 50 Promo codes to give away, if interested, drop a comment requesting one down below and I'll DM you a code.

They need to get out of lots of malls asap in order to save themselves.\n\nMany malls these days (except the rare truly upscale ones) are no longer destinations for people of all income brackets.  Instead, they cater to budget-minded 20-somethings and people with low incomes.  Upper-income people don't go to them.\n\nIn addition, many malls are increasingly run-down, and a blighted mall is a turnoff.\n\nTake upstate South Carolina.  Greenville, Spartanburg and Anderson used to have a range of malls, with all of them mid-range or upscale and generally with a mix of mid-range and more expensive stores.\n\nNow the only malls left are Haywood, Westgate and Anderson malls.  Haywood is a mid-tier mall, and Westgate and Anderson malls are run-down and feature low-end stores. Higher-end stores are in downtown Greenville and here and there in other locations, but not generally in malls.\n\nBelk, Dillard's and Macy's have stayed in malls.  The other stores in those malls don't attract the same broad range of customers as department stores attract, and the run-down condition of the malls is a turnoff.\n\nBelk, Dillard's and Macy's should close their mall stores (except maybe at Haywood) and build free-standing ones.  Otherwise they are doomed, stuck in run-down malls that their desired customers avoid."

At locations like Safeway, Walmart, Fred Meyer, etc. any place where you load your items on a belt that is designed to carry them to the cashier. \n\nYet, in almost every case, the cashier turns it off and reaches across it to grab what items they want to scan. \n\nThis is problematic for a few reasons. One, you\u2019re gonna kill your back. The job is already rough on your body as it is, but reaching like that will make it worse. \n\nTwo, if the belt doesn\u2019t advance, the next customer can\u2019t load their items. It\u2019s irritating to stand there with some items loaded, not being able to load more, while there\u2019s empty room up front because the cashier isn\u2019t letting the belt advance. \n\nI used to be a cashier (actually am one now in a place that has a counter, not a belt). I get wanting to plan your packing and that customers often put their items up in no logical order. But when I worked with a belt, I always let it bring the items to me and used the area around me to plan bagging. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand why you make more work for yourself, risk injury, and slow down the process?

I noticed that our competition never has issues with price erosion, but I can\u2019t figure out how they avoid it when we seem to have issues anytime there\u2019s a promotion (our 2 biggest competitors also promote). We do have separate channel plans, but the specs are close enough that certain retailers still seem to follow each other on like items. National promotions are a challenge as our main retailers all have different discount requirements. The one thing our competition does have is MSRP\u2018s listed on their own website. I\u2019m curious\u2026 Does anyone have a DTC model or MSRP\u2018s listed on their own website that help control price erosion? \n\nThe most recent example\u2026 We ran a promotion in Amazon\u2018s spring promo, two other retailers came down to match Amazon\u2018s promo, when the promo ended, Amazon did not go up because they are now matching those retailers. Then they went down a little bit each day. Our competition did not have this problem and Amazon went back up to the pre-promo retail. The only difference between us and them is that they have MSRP\u2018s listed on their brand website. \n\nEdit: i\u2019m not aware of a map policy for our competition but it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have one in place, I\u2019m mostly curious about the fact that they can get their retails to bounce back after a promo.

I'll give some examples below.\n\nI have been using PayPal too and it seems the buyer/seller protection is overall stronger.\n\nBut when it's CC payments, does PayPal help more to counter disputes or is it just like Stripe?\nStripe ist just a middleman, I know, but the banks side with buyers more often anyway.\n\nPersonal examples of Stripe disputes I've lost (unfairly):\n- buyer claims shipment did not arrive and after sending proof with their signature we still lost\n- buyer claims items are broken to get the money back, while in reality they just don't want to deal with returning an item (they admitted they just don't like the color)\n\nLet me know your thoughts!"

I noticed something interesting - at least a third of all orders, if not half, had multiple payment attempts. And most abandoned checkouts had failed payment attempts. My Stripe account allows me to see why these transactions didn't go through, and nearly ALL of them failed due to insufficient funds.\n\n(I sell a relatively higher ticket item so this may not be the case for you.)\n\nThis was an eye opening moment.

        "text": "I left Etsy about two years ago. At first, it felt like a terrifying decision. After all, Etsy is the giant marketplace where artists and makers sell their creations. It offers built-in traffic, a ready-made audience, and a system that takes care of the technical aspects of running an online store. But here\u2019s the thing: the deeper I got into it, the more I realized Etsy wasn\u2019t working for me\u2014it was working against me.\n\nThe Harsh Reality of Selling on Etsy\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Etsy\u2019s fees. They take a 30% cut of your earnings when you factor in listing fees, transaction fees, and payment processing deductions. That\u2019s a massive chunk of every sale gone before you even see your profits. For an artist who spends hours, sometimes weeks, crafting a piece, that fee starts to feel like a rip-off.\n\nEtsy defends its pricing by claiming it brings you traffic, which is true to some extent. But here\u2019s the catch: that traffic doesn\u2019t belong to you. It belongs to Etsy. You might get visitors to your shop, but they are constantly being presented with alternative options\u2014sometimes directly beneath your own listings. It felt like I was doing the work of bringing people to Etsy\u2019s platform, only for Etsy to push them towards other sellers.\n\nI started wondering: Am I the business here, or am I just another cog in Etsy\u2019s machine? Am I building my brand, or am I just feeding theirs?\n\nThe Hidden Competition and the Flood of Mass-Produced \"Art\"\n\nOne of the most frustrating things I experienced on Etsy was the growing influx of mass-produced, factory-made \u201cart\u201d flooding the marketplace. These pieces, often produced in bulk from overseas manufacturers, were being marketed alongside handmade, original works by real artists. Customers browsing Etsy might not even realize the difference.\n\nAnd the worst part? Etsy allowed it.\n\nThe platform, originally built to celebrate craftsmanship and unique creations, had turned into just another marketplace filled with mass production. Competing with real artists was one thing\u2014but competing with mass-manufactured products? That was the final dealbreaker for me.\n\nThe Leap to Independence: Building My Own Art Platform\n\nSo, I left.\n\nI started building my own art platform. No more reliance on Etsy\u2019s algorithm, no more worrying about mass-produced copies being marketed next to my work, no more losing 30% of every sale. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, and it certainly wasn\u2019t an overnight success.\n\nDid I get rich? No.\n\nDid it cost me everything? Not really.\n\nWas it hard? Yes\u2014but it was also incredibly rewarding.\n\nRunning my own store gave me full control. I decided how my art was presented, how my customers experienced my shop, and how I built relationships with buyers. Instead of being just another seller lost in Etsy\u2019s ocean, I was able to carve out a dedicated space where my art took center stage.\n\nThe Challenges of Running Your Own Art Store\n\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it: running your own shop comes with its own set of challenges. Here are a few things I had to navigate:\n\n1. Driving My Own Traffic\n\nEtsy does bring traffic, but as I said earlier, it\u2019s not really your traffic. Once I left, I had to figure out how to get eyes on my work. I spent time learning about SEO, social media marketing, and email newsletters. It was a learning curve, but over time, I started seeing real results\u2014results that belonged to me, not Etsy.\n\n2. Managing Tech & Logistics\n\nEtsy handles payments, shipping calculations, and customer inquiries. Running my own site meant setting all that up myself. It took time, but once it was in place, I actually found it easier to manage than I expected.\n\n3. Building Trust with Customers\n\nEtsy offers a layer of trust because buyers feel secure purchasing from a well-known platform. When you run your own site, you have to build that trust yourself through great customer service, transparent policies, and high-quality product photography and descriptions.\n\nThe Wins: Why It Was All Worth It\n\nFor every challenge, there was a win that made it all worth it.\n\nEvery sale feels more personal. When an order comes in from Australia, Sweden, or Switzerland, I know that person found me\u2014not just my shop buried in a sea of listings. These are NOT example countries, believe me or not I really sold already to all these countries some of my art! Incredible right?\nI set my own rules. No more Etsy policies dictating how I can market or price my work. What pictures I am allowed to upload and asking for getting my article \u201capproved\u201d. Never again!\nHigher profits per sale. Without Etsy\u2019s fees eating away at every transaction, I actually earn what my work is worth. And it feels very good, I can tell you that!\nStronger connections with buyers. I\u2019m not just another anonymous seller on a platform. I can build relationships with people who truly appreciate my work. And I have a chance of actually building my name as unique Artists not a number on an ebay sized art platform.\nShould You Leave Etsy?\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Etsy is all bad. If you\u2019re just starting out and need immediate visibility, it might be worth trying. But if you\u2019re frustrated by the constant fee hikes, the overwhelming competition, and the flood of mass-produced goods, then maybe it\u2019s time to think about your own store.\n\nLeaving Etsy isn\u2019t for everyone. It requires effort, patience, and a willingness to learn. But if you value independence and want to build something that truly belongs to you, it\u2019s absolutely possible\u2014and incredibly rewarding.\n\nA Thank You to Those Who Have Supported My Work\n\nSo here I am, more than a year into this adventure. It\u2019s been a ride, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. To everyone who has supported my art, whether by making a purchase, following along on social media, or just reading this post\u2014thank you.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about leaving Etsy and building your own store, I hope this post gives you the encouragement to take that leap. And if you\u2019re here just to browse my art, thank you for being here. Every visitor, every supporter, and every fellow artist who shares this journey means the world to me.\n\nHere\u2019s to creating, to independence, and to making art on our terms.\n\nPeter Hauerland\n\n"

        "text": "Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well!  \n  \nI recently started working with an e-commerce store (found them on Upwork) to automate their sales and inventory data aggregation. They changed the entire concept twice already, massively expanding my original scope. Because of that, I\u2019m planning either to finalize the project as is or ask them to formally increase the scope and budget if they want additional improvements. But got into thinking that maybe it\u2019s worth to finish it off anyway as something valuable for others, because had a problem with finding exact alternative.\n\nI wanted to discuss with those of you who own e-commerce and sell across multiple channels whether tools that offer similar functionalities exist and what they are, so I could propose as alternative(since the client doesn\u2019t fully like one part of current implementation - but more about it in a second).\n\n**So, what is it all about?**\n\nMy client sells across various channels, including Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Etsy, and TikTok. Each weekend, they manually compile inventory reports from several dashboards - including those related to inventory management, like Amazon, ShipStation and Lacore(never heard about it before) into a single spreadsheet to track demand, shortages, and other metrics.\n\nI was tasked with creating three automated spreadsheets: an Inventory Report, a Sales Value Report, and a Sales Units Report.\n\nHere's the workflow we agreed upon:\n\n**Inventory Workflow**  \nEverything begins with a master Google Sheet called the \u201cProducts List,\u201d which acts as the reference point for all the items you want to track. Each product\u2019s key identifiers (like SKUs or ASINs) are stored here, so if a product doesn\u2019t appear in this list, it won\u2019t show up in your reports.\n\nThe system once a week collects fresh inventory information from multiple platforms - such as Amazon, Walmart, ShipStation, and Lacore - automatically. Since each platform might label the same item differently, the data is cross-checked against what\u2019s in the \u201cProducts List.\u201d Once everything lines up, a single Google Sheet compiles it all. This sheet includes separate tabs showing inventory stats from each source (e.g., an Amazon tab, a Walmart tab, etc.) as well as a combined summary tab. They\u2019re organised by weeks of the year, so every time the system updates, you can see a week-by-week history of how many units you have available, inbound, or unfulfillable.\n\n**Sales Workflow**  \nThe process for sales is very similar, also relying on the same \u201cProducts List\u201d to match each product regardless of whether Amazon calls it an ASIN or Walmart uses a SKU. The system automatically grabs the data, ensuring you don\u2019t have to log in and export reports yourself.\n\nAll those transactions are cleaned and merged into one Google Sheet that includes sub-tabs for each sales channel, plus an overall summary of your total revenue and units sold. As with inventory, the data is laid out by weeks of the year, letting you quickly scroll through and see how your sales have changed over time, all in a single, user-friendly workbook.\n\nCurrently, one issue with this system is that the sales data isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't account for canceled or returned orders. Addressing this requires a more complex approach than simple weekly data aggregation.\n\nMy questions are:\u00a0\n\n1. Are there any existing off-the-shelf solutions you would recommend that perform similar multichannel data gathering functions? What do you use? This would allow me to suggest alternatives to my clients.\n2. Secondly, does having centralised, automated spreadsheets (or another format) for inventory and sales provide significant value that e-commerce owners might appreciate? How does that work in the real world?\n3. Any good ways to improve the system that I built?"
